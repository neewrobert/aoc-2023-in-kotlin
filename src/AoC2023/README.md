# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions Diary
For this year's Advent of Code, I'm going to try to keep a diary of my solutions. 
Each day's solution will be in a separate folder, and will contain a `README.md` file
with my thoughts and notes on the problem, and a `<dayX>.kt` file with my solution.

The idea of this is to keep a record of my thought process and how I approached each problem. Also, 
I'm hoping that by writing down my thoughts, I'll be able to better understand the problems and my solutions.


## Contents

- [DAY 01](./day01/README.md)
- [DAY 02](./day02/README.md)
- [DAY 03](./day03/README.md)
- ... in progress ...
- [DAY 10](./day10/README.md)
