# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions Diary
For this year's Advent of Code, I'm going to try to keep a diary of my solutions. 
Each day's solution will be in a separate folder, and will contain a `<day-x>.md` file
with my thoughts and notes on the problem, and a `<dayX>.kt` file with my solution.

The idea of this is to keep a record of my thought process and how I approached each problem. Also, 
I'm hoping that by writing down my thoughts, I'll be able to better understand the problems and my solutions.
